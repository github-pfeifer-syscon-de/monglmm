Version 0.1
	Intial release shows graphs for cpu,mem,net,disk,gpu,clk
	a selectable process graph
	filesystem usage, with load indicator
        the libg15 was modified so it uses libusb-1.0

10.8.20 added average clock, working for arm(c)
        (x64 as far as i coud see only supports actual clock value)
        very simple support for libgtop,
            on linux stick to proc/sys as this offers much more functions
           -> more fixing will be possible but as i did not have a hpux(c) around...
               if you want to try it use "configure --with-glibtop"

25.12.20 added process tree with different renderings,
           file sys with read/write indicator (as color)

19.1.21  added options for configure (see also ./configure --help)
        --with-libg15 display informations on g15(c) using usb
        --with-lmsensors use lmsensors for hardware infos (if no sensors show up may require setup once by sudo sensors-detect)
        --with-raspi for RaspberryPi(c) show core voltage (requires /opt/vc/... functions (c) Broadcom)
        --enable-debug enable debug, disable optimization

27.2.22 added used swap in mem display (as relative avail swap)

22.9.22 for configure:
     added --with-gles using GL ES 3 e.g. useful on Raspi's (suggested same use on GenericGlm)
     lately i had problems when enable --with-raspi that includes the broadcom opengl libs, that break desktop GL, but as i haven't seen the voltage move that seems tolerable

23.12.22 improved support GPU values, user selection
     for openGL queries are supported (which only show application local values (primitives/samples), so --with-gles makes best use of resources)
     the suport for other GPU values depends on GL extensions support for AMDperfCounters which seems being quite commonly used

20.7.24 added detail view for processes ("classic" Gui),
      select a process then double click to show the depending processes en d√©tail
	(as far as the values from proc are sufficient) as tree,
      allows also some basic network connection infos.
